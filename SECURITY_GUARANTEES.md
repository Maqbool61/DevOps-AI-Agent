# Security Guarantees and Safety

## Can Your Organization Use This Agent Securely?

**YES - The agent is designed with enterprise security and safety as the top priority.**

---

## Security Guarantees

### 1. Secure by Design

**Architecture Security:**
- No external data exfiltration
- All operations logged and audited
- Credentials encrypted at rest
- API keys never logged
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforced

**Code Security:**
- No shell injection vulnerabilities
- Uses `shlex.split()` for safe command execution
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

**Network Security:**
- TLS/SSL encryption for all communications
- Webhook authentication required
- IP whitelist support
- API key authentication
- Optional VPN/bastion integration

---

### 2. Will It Be Hacked?

**Multiple Security Layers:**

**Layer 1: Authentication**
```python
# API Key authentication required
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>

# Webhook signature verification
X-Signature: <HMAC-SHA256>

# IP whitelist
ALLOWED_IPS=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.1.0/24
```

**Layer 2: Authorization**
```yaml
# RBAC configuration
roles:
  - name: agent
    permissions:
      - read:pods
      - restart:services
      - read:logs
    forbidden:
      - delete:*
      - drop:*
      - format:*
```

**Layer 3: Encryption**
```bash
# All credentials encrypted
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<encrypted>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<encrypted>
SMTP_PASSWORD=<encrypted>

# TLS for all connections
ENABLE_TLS=true
TLS_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
TLS_KEY=/path/to/key.pem
```

**Layer 4: Network Isolation**
```
Deploy in private network
Access via VPN or bastion host
No direct internet exposure
Internal DNS only
```

**Layer 5: Audit Trail**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-12T13:00:00Z",
  "user": "agent",
  "action": "restart_service",
  "resource": "nginx",
  "result": "success",
  "ip": "10.0.1.5",
  "signature": "verified"
}
```

---

### 3. Security Features

**Built-in Security Controls:**

**Command Whitelisting:**
```python
# Only safe commands allowed
SAFE_COMMANDS = [
    "systemctl restart",
    "systemctl status",
    "kubectl get",
    "kubectl logs",
    "nginx -t",
    "apache2ctl configtest"
]
```

**Command Blacklisting:**
```python
# Dangerous commands blocked forever
BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [
    r"rm\s+-rf\s+/",           # Recursive delete root
    r"format\s+",               # Format disk
    r"mkfs\.",                  # Make filesystem
    r"dd\s+if=",                # Disk operations
    r"DROP\s+DATABASE",         # Drop database
    r"TRUNCATE\s+TABLE",        # Truncate table
    r"DELETE\s+FROM.*WHERE\s+1" # Delete all rows
]
```

**Real-time Security Scanning:**
```python
# Scans configurations for security issues
security_checks = [
    "privileged_containers",
    "exposed_secrets",
    "unencrypted_http",
    "weak_passwords",
    "missing_rbac",
    "open_ports"
]
```

**Compliance Validation:**
```python
# Validates against security standards
compliance_frameworks = [
    "CIS_Benchmarks",
    "SOC2",
    "PCI-DSS",
    "HIPAA",
    "GDPR"
]
```

## Safety Guarantees

### 1. Will It Delete Anything?

**NO - The agent NEVER deletes production data.**

**What It Will NEVER Do:**

```
PERMANENTLY BLOCKED OPERATIONS:

❌ Delete databases
❌ Drop tables
❌ Format disks
❌ Remove user data
❌ Delete production files
❌ Truncate tables
❌ Recursive delete on /
❌ Remove backups
❌ Delete logs (old logs only rotated)
❌ Remove git repositories
```

**What It WILL Do (Safe Operations):**

```
✅ Restart services (nginx, apache, etc.)
✅ Reload configurations
✅ Clear cache (Redis, application cache)
✅ Rotate logs (keeps last N days)
✅ Clean package cache (safe, can re-download)
✅ Remove temp files (/tmp, /var/tmp)
✅ Increase resource limits
✅ Fix file permissions
✅ Test configurations
✅ Collect diagnostics
```

**Safety Mechanism:**

```python
# Before EVERY command
def execute_command(command):
    # 1. Check if command is dangerous
    if is_dangerous(command):
        # Send email to SRE team
        send_email(
            subject="DANGEROUS OPERATION DETECTED",
            body=f"Command blocked: {command}",
            instructions="Manual steps: ..."
        )
        return "BLOCKED"
    
    # 2. Dry-run first
    result = dry_run(command)
    if result.failed:
        return "DRY_RUN_FAILED"
    
    # 3. Execute safely
    result = execute(command)
    
    # 4. Verify success
    verification = verify_fix()
    
    # 5. Document
    generate_documentation()
    
    return result
```

---

### 2. Email Before ANY Dangerous Action

**Automatic Email Alerts:**

```
TO: sre-team@company.com
SUBJECT: DANGEROUS OPERATION DETECTED - APPROVAL REQUIRED

A potentially dangerous operation was detected:

Operation: Delete old database backups
Command: rm -rf /backups/db-2024-*
Reason: Disk space full
Risk Level: HIGH

WHY THIS IS BLOCKED:
- Could delete recent backups
- No way to recover if wrong files deleted
- Should be reviewed by human

MANUAL STEPS:
1. Review backup retention policy
2. Check which backups are safe to delete:
   ls -lh /backups/db-2024-* | head -20
3. Delete only confirmed old backups:
   rm /backups/db-2024-01-*.tar.gz
4. Verify disk space:
   df -h

VERIFICATION:
- Backup policy followed
- Recent backups intact
- Disk space recovered

DO NOT proceed without review!

Incident ID: INC-2026-001

## Fix Accuracy Guarantee

### Will the Fixes Be Accurate?

**YES - Multi-stage verification ensures accuracy.**

**Accuracy Mechanisms:**

**1. AI Analysis (Claude):**
```python
# Agent uses Claude AI to analyze incidents
analysis = claude.analyze(
    context={
        "logs": nginx_logs,
        "metrics": prometheus_metrics,
        "history": past_incidents
    },
    question="What is the root cause and how to fix it?"
)

# Claude provides:
# - Root cause analysis
# - Recommended fix
# - Potential side effects
# - Verification steps
```

**2. Confidence Scoring:**
```python
if analysis.confidence < 0.8:
    # Low confidence, send to human
    send_email("Manual review required")
else:
    # High confidence, auto-fix
    execute_fix()
```

**3. Immediate Verification:**
```python
# After fix applied
verification = verify_fix(
    expected_state={
        "service": "running",
        "health": "200 OK",
        "errors": "none"
    }
)

if not verification.passed:
    # Fix failed, rollback
    rollback()
    send_email("Fix failed, rolled back")
```

**4. Stability Monitoring:**
```python
# Monitor for 5 minutes
stability = monitor_stability(
    duration=300,
    interval=30,
    checks=[
        "service_running",
        "no_errors_in_logs",
        "response_time_normal",
        "error_rate_low"
    ]
)

if stability.success_rate < 0.9:
    send_alert("Fix unstable, needs review")
```

**5. Rollback on Failure:**
```python
if fix_failed or not_stable:
    # Automatic rollback
    rollback_to_previous_state()
    
    # Notify team
    send_email(
        subject="Fix failed, rolled back",
        details=failure_reason
    )
```

---

---

## Database Access (Optional)

**Default: DISABLED** (`ENABLE_DATABASE_COLLECTION=false`)

The agent does **not** connect to or query databases unless you explicitly enable it.

**Blocked by default:**
- AWS: RDS, ElastiCache, DynamoDB
- GCP: Cloud SQL, Firestore, Memorystore
- Azure: SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Redis Cache

**Still works without database access:**
- Connection pool / timeout issues at the app layer
- Restarting app services, scaling pods
- Network, firewall, and load balancer checks
- Email to DBA team with manual investigation steps

**To enable (security team approval required):**
```bash
# .env
ENABLE_DATABASE_COLLECTION=true
```

Only enable after:
- Security review and data classification approval
- Read-only IAM/RBAC roles scoped to specific instances
- Audit logging for all database API calls

See `collectors/database_policy.py` for implementation.
